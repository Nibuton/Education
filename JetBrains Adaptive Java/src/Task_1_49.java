/*
Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (the number is repeated as many times, to what it equals to). Input to the program is a positive integer n â€“ the number of the elements of the sequence the program should print. On the output, it is expected to get the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated.

For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
